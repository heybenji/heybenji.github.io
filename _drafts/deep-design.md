Thoughts on this post

* Feeling very "isolated" right now. Want to bring in team context, participatory design etc.
* The tone is kind of manifesto-ey. Part of me likes that. Part of me likes the snark. But I don't want the sell to be so hard that I come off as a total egomaniac.
* It feels like two posts. One about "what I do" and one about "deep design". Transition feels kind of rough.
* I would like to have more about what deep design is on a pragmatic level (see point 1 about participatory design and context). Feels kind of ideological and ungrounded in wisdom.
* I like the idea of starting off with something rootsy and conversational like it is right now. The problem is that it's hard to transition from the I statements of what I do to the broader context.




What do you do? Deep design.

What do you do? It's a simple enough question on the surface. And there are a lot of simple answers: "I make websites for nonprofits" or "I'm a user experience designer" or "I help run a co-working space focused on art and social justice." These answers have a certain solidity. They give whomever asked the question something to grab onto.

But the truth is that, like [Tobias Mayer](http://bizcraft.tumblr.com/post/112742470752/what-do-you-do), I have a really hard time with the question because all those simple answers feel wrong. What I actually do, and what people actually seem to value about my work is... hard to encapsulate.

But I think I've figured it out. Let me try to boil it down.

What I do is complex. On a team I might cycle through half a dozen different roles in order to move it forward: designer, process consultant, facilitator, developer, strategist, visionary, secretary. Because what I do isn't the roles I take, or the things I make. 

It's working with all the people who care about the outcome of a project to cut through the crap and make something awesome.

What I do is deep design.

Deep design doesn't stop at how something looks, how it functions, or even at somebody's "experience" of it. Deep design is not only designing the thing itself, but also transforming its context.

There's a lot of talk right now on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20140602124457-338303448-why-the-most-successful-companies-embrace-design), [Co.Design](http://www.fastcodesign.com/3016247/10-lessons-for-design-driven-success) and the four corners of the Internet about how organizations need to embrace design to maximize "innovation" and "disruption." Your organization needs to be "design-driven." Your organization doesn't just need thinking, it needs "design thinking" whatever the fuck that is. Put designers on every team, and you will have "innovation." Guaranteed. Apple did it and "disrupted" everything. Google's doing it and getting [patted on the back](http://www.wired.com/2014/12/google-material-design/) in Wired. You too can embrace design, "disrupt" something, and "innovate" off into the sunset.

Here's the problem. Really embracing design does not mean a token designer on every team, touching up that brochure, or making your "buy this" or "donation" button rounder. 

Deeply embracing design means questioning everything about your organization, and if necessary changing every cherished structure, department, and job title if they get in the way of doing something great.

And that, at base, is what deep design is all about. If an organization wants to execute something transformative, it must also do the work of transformation.
