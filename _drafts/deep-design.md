What's that? To me, deep design is radically engaging people in the design of something as well as its context.

It's working with all the people who care about the outcome of a project to cut through the crap and make something awesome.

Deep design doesn't stop at how something looks, how it functions, or even at somebody's "experience" of it. Deep design is not only designing the thing _itself,_ but also transforming its _context_.

There's a lot of talk right now on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20140602124457-338303448-why-the-most-successful-companies-embrace-design), [Co.Design](http://www.fastcodesign.com/3016247/10-lessons-for-design-driven-success) and the four corners of the Internet about how organizations need to embrace design to maximize "innovation" and "disruption." Your organization needs to be "design-driven." Your organization doesn't just need thinking, it needs "design thinking" whatever the fuck _that_ is. Put designers on every team, and you will have "innovation." Guaranteed. Apple did it and "disrupted" everything. Google's doing it and is getting [patted on the back in Wired](http://www.wired.com/2014/12/google-material-design/). You too can embrace design, "disrupt" something, and "innovate" off into the sunset.

Here's the problem. Deeply embracing design does not mean putting a token designer on every team, touching up that brochure, or making your "buy this" or "donate now" button rounder. 

Deeply embracing design means questioning everything about your organization, and if necessary changing every cherished structure, department, and job title if they get in the way of doing something great.

And that, at base, is what deep design is all about. If your organization wants to execute something transformative, it must also do the work of transformation.


Thoughts on this post

* Feeling very "isolated" right now. Want to bring in team context, participatory design etc.
* The tone is kind of manifesto-ey. Part of me likes that. Part of me likes the snark. But I don't want the sell to be so hard that I come off as a total egomaniac.
* It feels like two posts. One about "what I do" and one about "deep design". Transition feels kind of rough.
* I would like to have more about what deep design is on a pragmatic level (see point 1 about participatory design and context). Feels kind of ideological and ungrounded in wisdom.
* I like the idea of starting off with something rootsy and conversational like it is right now. The problem is that it's hard to transition from the I statements of what I do to the broader context.
