Settling into my role as a dedicated user researcher, I recently felt the need for some guiding principles. By way of my previous roles product manager and then designer before that, I've run across principles that have stuck with me. In particular, the Design Justice Network Principles and Consentful Tech Project inform the list below.

### Enthusiastic consent
Seek enthusiastic consent from participants in research.

### Connect the dots
Use the information we already have in new and exciting ways that fosters relationships between our teams and between our organization and our users.

### Spark curiosity
Find ways of presenting information that sparks curiosity about our users among our teams.

### Every assumption is an opportunity
Advocate for users with evidence to address real problems, not imagined ones.

### Make it easy
Make it less costly to ask a customer than to operate on an assumption.

### Include everybody, especially those most impacted
Check in not only with our existing users, but also the users we want 8 years from now, and the people most impacted by our product decisions.

### Ask questions, always
We learn about our users by asking them questions. While quantitative data is important, qualitative data and storytelling is the soul of our work.
