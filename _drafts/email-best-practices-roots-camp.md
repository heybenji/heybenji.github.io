Deliverability (watch words)
How a list for a particular kind of engagement doesn't translate necessarily into another form of engagement
Mitigating list fatigue with variety, giving list members something, sometimes just informational stuff
Gathering feedback by asking for it non-quantitatively (simple questions: What do you want to see?)

Ultimately, email is just another form of communication, and all effective communication requires empathy and reciprocity.
