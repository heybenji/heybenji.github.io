Much of my work is a team effort. Hereâ€™s credit where credit is due.

The [Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts Annual Reports](http://www.bluecrossma.com/together2014) were designed by the incredible Renessa Ciampa of [Ciampa Creative](http://www.ciampacreative.com), and built by me. Alan Raymond was managing editor and wrote the main Corporate report, and Sarah Welch DeMayo of [Vibrancy Communications](http://www.vibrancycom.com) wrote the Corporate Citizenship and Diversity & Inclusion reports.

[ActBlue](http://www.actblue.com) has gone through some design changes since I was a designer and front-end developer on their team from 2006-2009. I can only take credit for some of the CSS and HTML markup that remains, though the fact that it is still in their codebase is a testament either to their laziness or the enduring quality of the work. [Rocket](https://twitter.com/rocket_nova) also contributed CSS, markup and Ruby on Rails development.

[Public Transit Public Good](http://www.publictransitpublicgood.org) for Community Labor United, [CERO Recycling Co-op](http://www.cero.coop), and [Upwell](http://www.upwell.us) were designed and built by me during my time as a worker-owner at [Quilted](http://quilted.coop), with build support from fellow worker-owners [Rocket](https://twitter.com/rocket_nova) and Colin Sagan.

I designed and built [Interaction Institute for Social Change](http://www.interactioninstitute.org) with some massive build support from [Mark Toce](http://www.marktoce.com).

[Bitch Magazine](http://www.bitchmagazine.org) was a whole-team effort at [Quilted](http://quilted.coop).
