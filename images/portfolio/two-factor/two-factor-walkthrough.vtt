<v ->Here's a quick walkthrough of the more secure</v>

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.760
two-factor authentication flow that I designed for ActBlue.

3
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.180
Because security was really important to get right,

4
00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:10.920
I worked with an engineer to understand

5
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.140
every possible permutation that could come up

6
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.070
as a user was enrolling or de-enrolling their device.

7
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.930
I also designed and coded email notifications

8
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.290
that would alert users to important actions taken

9
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:26.140
on their account.

10
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.040
In addition to that,

11
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:34.040
I introduced a security menu item to the global navigation,

12
00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.600
and nudges to help folks know the next action

13
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.370
that they could take to improve the security

14
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.220
of their account.

15
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.290
Let's take a quick look at the clickable prototype

16
00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.683
and go through the setup flow.

17
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.983
So first folks would set up stronger authentication.

18
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.203
They'd download their app, scan it, and enter it.

19
00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.350
And that's basically it.

20
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.300
They'd be enabled.

21
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.830
They could also generate backup codes

22
00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.690
in case they lost their device.

23
00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.640
In that case they need to verify their password to continue

24
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.630
and then they'd get their backup codes

25
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.510
to either download or copy to their device,

26
00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.130
and they could also hide those codes

27
00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.220
after they were doing it to prevent shoulder surfing.

28
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.610
Finally, they'd see in their latest activity

29
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.850
all the important account related actions

30
00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.323
that they had taken recently.
