<v ->Here's a walkthrough</v>

2
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:03.600
of the Better Ticket Editing workflow

3
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.373
that I designed for ActBlue.

4
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:09.750
So you can see we already have three ticket types here

5
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.030
and I've decided that I want my free ticket

6
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.853
to be prioritized so that folks come to the event.

7
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.200
You can see that's reflected immediately in the preview

8
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.400
and you also have the option to publish now.

9
00:00:22.988 --> 00:00:25.770
I'm kind of waffling on the VIP section actually

10
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:30.770
so maybe I'll archive it, or actually I just heard

11
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.450
from the venue and they have a little bit more space

12
00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.760
so I think it's worth doing.

13
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.050
So I'm gonna un-archive it.

14
00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.280
I'm gonna edit it

15
00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.620
and I'm gonna actually increase the number of tickets

16
00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.363
to 15 and the maximum tickets per transaction to five,

17
00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.293
just so it's easier to sell those VIP tickets.

18
00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.770
I'm also asking a question about dietary preferences

19
00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.283
because our VIP pass includes meals.

20
00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:59.433
Looks great.

21
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.910
I can also add another ticket type if I want.

22
00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.660
I'm not gonna do that right now

23
00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.500
and I think this looks good

24
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.350
so I'm gonna go ahead and publish it.
