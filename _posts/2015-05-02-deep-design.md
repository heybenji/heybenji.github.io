I recently [wrote a post]({{ '/posts/what-do-you-do/' | prepend: site.baseurl }}) about my struggle to describe simply an interdisciplinary, participatory design practice. I ended up with two words: _deep design._ In truth, deep design is just design _as it should be,_ but the word "design" is so abused right now that it needs a modifier. Case in point...

There's a lot of talk right now on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20140602124457-338303448-why-the-most-successful-companies-embrace-design), [Co.Design](http://www.fastcodesign.com/3016247/10-lessons-for-design-driven-success) and the four corners of the Internet about how organizations need to embrace design to maximize "innovation" and "disruption." Your organization needs to be "design-driven." Your organization doesn't just need _thinking,_ it needs "design thinking" whatever the fuck _that_ is. Put designers on every team, and you will have "innovation." Guaranteed. Apple did it and "disrupted" everything. Google's doing it and is getting [patted on the back in Wired](http://www.wired.com/2014/12/google-material-design/). You too can embrace design, "disrupt" something, and "innovate" off into the sunset.

Here's the problem. Embracing design does not mean putting a token designer on every team, creating a dazzling style guide that leaves nothing to the imagination, or making your "buy this" or "donate now" button rounder. Deeply embracing design means questioning everything about your organization, and if necessary changing every cherished structure, department, and job title if they get in the way of doing something great. 

And that's why I've started saying _deep design._ Because our mind-jacked culture needs a phrase that conveys:

 * how design doesn't stop at how something looks, how it functions, or even at somebody's "experience" of it; 
 * how design is not only designing the thing _itself,_ but also transforming its _context;_ 
 * how design is understanding deeply the cause of a problem and designing transformative solutions in collaboration with the people most affected. 

It can be as simple as involving the staff who are responsible for updating a website in the design of the tool they'll use to update it, to as complex as engaging a diverse public in envisioning a city's new transportation future. In essence, deep design is [participatory design](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_design), but with a more radical mandate: the solution to a problem might come from transforming or rethinking its entire context.

That's the promise and the threat of deep design. If you want to do something transformative, you must also do the work of transformation.

What's that? To me, deep design is radically engaging people in the design of something as well as its context.

Deep design is radically engaging the people who are affected by a problem in the design of solutions that include the entire context of the problem. as well as the transformation of its context.

Deep design is radically engaging the people who are affected to design solutions that include the entire context of the problem. 

as well as the transformation of its context.

Deep design is the radical notion that in order to solve a problem, you must engage the people most affected by the problem in designing solutions that address the problem itself but also potentially transforming its context.

It's working with all the people who care about the outcome of a project to cut through the crap and make something awesome.

Deep design is the radical notion that sometimes designing a solution to a problem is more about transforming the context of the problem than designing the thing itself.

Deep design is problem-solving through considering and intentionally transforming a problem as well as its context.

Deep design is fundamentally about using our collective intelligence to imagine solutions that go beyond our current definition of a problem.

Deep design is about understanding a problem so deeply that its context becomes fundamentally transformed.

Deep design is diving so far into a problem that you turn it inside out. What is causing the problem? Can the solution address not the problem but the context itself?

Deep design is applying design to both a problem and its context in collaboration with the people who most need a solution.

Deep design doesn't stop at how something looks, how it functions, or even at somebody's "experience" of it. Deep design is not only designing the thing _itself,_ but also transforming its _context_.

Thoughts on this post

* Feeling very "isolated" right now. Want to bring in team context, participatory design etc.
* The tone is kind of manifesto-ey. Part of me likes that. Part of me likes the snark. But I don't want the sell to be so hard that I come off as a total egomaniac.
* It feels like two posts. One about "what I do" and one about "deep design". Transition feels kind of rough.
* I would like to have more about what deep design is on a pragmatic level (see point 1 about participatory design and context). Feels kind of ideological and ungrounded in wisdom.
* I like the idea of starting off with something rootsy and conversational like it is right now. The problem is that it's hard to transition from the I statements of what I do to the broader context.
