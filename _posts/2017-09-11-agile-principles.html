<p>Having the right practices can feel like a good vacation: enough structure that you feel secure and know your options, but enough flexibility that you can be spontaneous and go with the flow.</p>

<p>These are some practices I've picked up over the years that have helped me and the teams I've worked with stay flexible, self-organize, and problem-solve. I've organized them into principles as scaffolding for staying clear on why, even as new practices are incorporated. Many of them come from Scrum, Kanban, and Extreme Programming, a few major approaches to agility.</p>
